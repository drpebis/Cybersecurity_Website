CYBER-SECURITY WEBSITE !

A website that can function as a free and quick way to learn important and basic cybersecurity concepts.
Coded in ASP.NET Core MVC 

-30 Aug Update:
The base classes in C# are written and the code currently supports the baseline functionality of pulling and writing reports.
Note: If you're messing around in the code and are trying to get past the login screen the username is "Alex" and password is
"password" (Case sensitive). Is it funny that a cybersecurity project has such a bad password? I think so, but it is only for testing.
